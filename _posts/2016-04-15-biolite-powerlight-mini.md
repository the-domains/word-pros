  BioLite became leaders in the cooking and charging market thanks to their
  nifty wood burning CampStove (with portable grill) that generates electricity.
  For 2016, they now offer a lighter, battery-powered version called the
  CookStove for those who want an easy-to-start campfire but don't need the
  added perk of device-charging.
